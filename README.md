**I’ve been coding every day for the past 2 years**—building:
**Mobile apps** (iOS, Android) **Websites** Experimenting with **UX-enhancing libraries**

**Let’s be real:** AI could probably do most of that **in minutes**—what took me **two years**.

LLMs are **revolutionary**—but still **mysterious black boxes**.  
We’re only beginning to explore their true capabilities.  

I believe the future of the software is **AI-Driven Software Lifecyle** and success requires:  
→ Understanding how these tools work.
→ Setting crystal‑clear goals (thinking through your product thoroughly and expressing it in text)  
→ Crafting precise prompts  
→ Providing the right context  
Achieving all of this demands a deep understanding of what happens under the hood and the agility to learn quickly to stay relevant.

“Software development” as we know it will be largely **automated**.  
In its place: **AI-savvy engineers** who can design scalable, maintainable, secure, and engaging products—and integrate AI through RAG pipelines or agents that drive real business value—will be in high demand.

I’m focusing on end‑to‑end AI‑driven software development in startups: from eye‑catching designs and rock‑solid backends to AI integration, seamless deployments, and high uptime—bridging engineering and architecture with AI at every step
