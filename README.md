**I’ve been coding every day for the past 2 years** — building: **Mobile apps** 📱 (iOS, Android), **Websites** 🌐, and experimenting with **User experience -enhancing libraries**.

**Let’s be real:** AI 🤖 could probably do most of that **in minutes** — what took me **two years** ⏳.

LLMs are **revolutionary** — but still **mysterious black boxes**.  
We’re only beginning to explore their true capabilities.

I believe the future of software is **AI-Driven Software Lifecycle** — and success requires:  
→ Understanding how these tools work  
→ Setting crystal‑clear goals (thinking through your product thoroughly and expressing it in text)  
→ Crafting precise prompts  
→ Providing the right context 🧠
Achieving all of this demands a deep understanding of what happens under the hood and the agility to learn quickly to stay relevant.

“Software development” as we know it will be largely **automated**.  
In its place: **AI-savvy engineers** who can design scalable, maintainable, secure, and engaging products — and integrate AI through RAG pipelines or agents that drive real business value — will be in high demand 🚀.

I’m focusing on **end‑to‑end AI‑driven software development in startups**:  
From eye‑catching designs and rock‑solid backends to AI integration, seamless deployments, and high uptime — bridging engineering and architecture with AI at every step.
